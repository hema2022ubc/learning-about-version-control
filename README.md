# Learning about Version Control

Author: He Ma

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

Like most about version control: With version control, I do not need to copy the same files and folders many times and team members can work on the project simultaneously.

Challenging about version control: The most challenging part is to resolve merge conflicts in Jupyter Notebook files: `.ipynb` because the file format sometimes gets corrupted and cannot be opened.
